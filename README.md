# HR-Analytics

Problem Statement:
HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources has been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Here we are trying to identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

The data is taken from Analytics Vidhya competition. The data is attached in this repository itself or can also be found in Analytics Vidhya.
